# Drought
This repository contains the R scripts used for the assignment in the "Drought" course taught at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) for the Flood risk management master's programme at the Escola TÃ¨cnica Superior d'Enginyers de Camins, Canals i Ports de Barcelona.

The scrips read NC files for regional climate downscaled data (from CORDEX) and sample a point in Costa Rica for the analysis of the variables of temperature, precipitation and runoff.
